"""Five READMEs carry the same family list, differing in one arrow.

`test_family_claims.py` pins the paragraph above the list — the pitch, written
out five times, so a re-word in one repo cannot quietly disagree with the other
four.  It does not look at the list itself, and the list is the part that was
copied.

These sections were made by pasting one into the next.  What survives that is
five identical rosters; what does not is `← you are here`, which has to move
one row every time.  A marker left where the last paste put it points a reader
at the wrong tool, and reads exactly like a correct README — the sentence is
well-formed, the link works, it is just about somebody else's project.

The counts are the other half.  "Five tools" and "all five" are written in
words, in prose, nowhere near the list they count.  A sixth tool means editing
five READMEs in three places each, and the two words are the places most easily
missed: everything still renders, and the list quietly outnumbers its own
description.

So: the rows are counted against the words that count them, the arrow is
checked to be on this tool and no other, and each row is checked to link to the
tool it names rather than to whichever one was pasted next to it.
