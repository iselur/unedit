"""`--version` has to say the version that was installed.

There are two copies of this number in every repo in the family: the one in
`pyproject.toml`, which is what the wheel is named and what PyPI serves, and
`__version__` in the package, which is what `--version` prints.  A release bumps
the first one.  Nothing bumps the second one, and nothing noticed:

    unedit     pyproject 0.1.4   __init__ 0.1.3
    agentdiff  pyproject 0.1.3   __init__ 0.1.2

Both of those are published.  `pip install unedit==0.1.4` installs 0.1.4 and
then `unedit --version` says 0.1.3, so a bug report against it names a release
that does not contain the bug, and the maintainer looks in the wrong tree.

The existing version test in each repo compares `--version` against
`__version__` — the same number on both sides of the assertion, so it passes
however far the two copies have drifted.  This one reads `pyproject.toml` off
disk instead, which is the only side that is true by construction: it is what
the build actually ships under.

`tomllib` is 3.11 and this package supports 3.9, so the version is read with a
regex rather than a parser.  A key called `version` at the top level of
`[project]` is not a shape that needs parsing.
