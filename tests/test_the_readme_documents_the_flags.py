"""Every flag the parser has, findable in the README — and the reverse.

A flag nobody can discover is a flag nobody uses.  unedit grew a `--force` and a `--hard`,
and the README never mentioned `--version`: it worked, it was tested, and the
only way to find it was `--help` or the source.  The opposite failure is worse
— a README quoting a flag the parser dropped hands somebody a command line that
exits 2 on them.

Both directions are checked here.  A flag counts as documented if any of its
spellings appears in the README, because `-m` and `--message` are the same flag
and the short one is what the examples use.

The reverse direction reads only fenced code blocks, and only the flags on a
command line belonging to unedit itself.  READMEs discuss other programs — the
sentence explaining that `claude --resume` opens a *new* session file is about
Claude Code, not about this tool, and a naive sweep for `--` in the prose reads
it as a flag unedit has lost.
