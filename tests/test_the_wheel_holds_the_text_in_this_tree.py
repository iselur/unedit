"""The wheel in `dist/` is this code — the text of it, not just its number.

`test_the_built_wheel_is_this_code` checks the version three ways and stops
there, which is one step short of the thing it is about.  A wheel built this
morning and a tree edited this afternoon carry the same `__version__`, agree
on every check in that file, and differ in what they contain.  That is not
hypothetical: all three parked dists in this family had it at once, and every
version check passed on all three.

What drifted was the README, and the README is not documentation here — the
long description in a wheel's METADATA *is* the project page on PyPI.  So the
page describing the tool loses whatever was added since the build: in
agentwatch's case three flags that exist, work, and are documented in the
repository and nowhere a user would look.

The number matters more than it looks.  A PyPI filename is immutable, so a
first release ships its page exactly once.  There is no corrected upload of
`agentwatch-0.1.0`; there is only a version bump, which for a page typo is a
silly thing to spend and for a first release is not available at all.

Modules are checked the same way for the same reason.  A version that agrees
with itself says nothing about whether the code under it moved, and a stale
module is the shipped bug the neighbouring file already tells the story of —
caught there by its number, invisible here when the number happens to match.

No `dist/` means nothing to compare, and this skips.  The failure only exists
once a build does.
