"""A wheel sitting in `dist/` is the thing that goes to PyPI. Is it this code?

`test_the_version_it_reports` checks that `pyproject.toml` and the package
agree, and it passed the whole time `unedit --version` was printing 0.1.3 to
everyone who installed 0.1.4 from PyPI.  It passed because it was right: the
*source* agreed with itself.  What went wrong was one step later.

`dist/` still held the wheel built before that fix.  `twine upload
--skip-existing` decides by filename, so it saw `unedit-0.1.4-py3-none-any.whl`
already on PyPI and skipped — the corrected build could never replace it, and
PyPI filenames are immutable, so the fix could not ship under that number at
all.  It took a version bump to get out.

So this checks the one thing no other test looked at: whether the artifact
about to be uploaded contains the code in this working tree.  A stale wheel is
a stale wheel whatever the source says, and the moment to find out is before
the upload, not from a user's `--version`.

There is usually no `dist/` — a clean checkout has none, and this skips.  That
is not a hole: the failure only exists when a build exists, and it appears the
moment someone builds one.
