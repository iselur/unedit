"""Every command the README shows, handed to the parser that would get it.

The other README tests check what the page *says*. `test_the_command_table_is_
the_parser` pins the table of commands, `test_the_readme_documents_the_flags`
pins that each flag is written down somewhere, `test_the_readme_shows_what_it_
prints` pins the output blocks.  None of them touch the examples — the command
lines a reader copies.

Those are the lines most likely to be wrong and least likely to be noticed.  A
flag renamed in the parser leaves the table failing loudly and the examples
failing quietly, because to every test that has read this page so far an
example is prose.  The reader finds out by pasting it and getting `error:
unrecognized arguments`.

Nothing is run.  Each line is split the way a shell would split it and handed
to the parser the tool actually uses, which asks whether the command would be
accepted and not what it would do — so this is safe anywhere and touches
nothing on disk.

Two kinds of line live in these blocks and both are checked, because dropping
one kind quietly is how a page keeps a command that no longer exists:

  unedit save -m "before agent refactor"     an example: it has to parse
  unedit save [-m MSG] [--force]             a synopsis: `[` and `<` mean the
                                             reader fills that in, so it is
                                             read for its subcommand instead

Anything that is neither — a line naming the tool in the middle of a sentence
inside a fence — is not shaped like a command and is not treated as one.
