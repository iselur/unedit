"""The four claims every README in this family makes, checked against the code.

    Five tools for working with coding agents, same house style: zero
    dependencies, MIT, no API key, nothing leaves your machine. None of them
    call a model — that is the point, since the thing being checked already is
    one.

That paragraph is the pitch.  It is repeated verbatim in all five READMEs, and
until this file existed it was checked in none of them — which is the worst
shape for a claim to be in, because being written five times reads as being
agreed five times rather than as being asserted five times.

Each sentence is mechanical, so each gets a test:

    zero dependencies      every import resolves to the standard library or to
                           this package; `[project.dependencies]` is empty
    nothing leaves         nothing that can open a socket is imported, and
    your machine           nothing is imported by name at runtime either
    no API key             no environment variable that looks like a
                           credential is read
    none of them           no provider hostname or SDK appears anywhere in the
    call a model           package

The last one is the load-bearing claim of the whole family: these tools check
an agent's work, and a checker that phoned a model would be marking its own
homework.  It is also the one a maintainer could break by accident, in a single
convenience import, which is exactly why it belongs to the machine and not to
somebody's memory.
